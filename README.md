# Real-Time Weather Modification Scene

This project was developed as part of CGRA350, focusing on real-time rendering techniques. Our group of four collaborated to create an interactive scene where users can modify various weather conditions and explore a dynamically generated environment.

## Project Overview

The scene allows users to:

- Navigate through a dynamically generated terrain.
- Interact with clouds that can be modified in real-time.
- Adjust lighting using a ray tracing algorithm.
- Initiate cinematic views showcasing different perspectives of the scene.

## Clouds Module

In this project, I primarily focused on developing the clouds module. The clouds are modeled objects with customizable parameters including:

- Opacity: Control the transparency of the clouds.
- Density: Adjust the concentration of clouds in the sky.
- Amplitude: Modify the scale of cloud movement.
- Movement Speed: Change the speed at which clouds move across the sky.
  
The goal was to create realistic cloud formations that respond dynamically to user input, enhancing the overall visual realism and user experience of the scene.

## Scene Interaction

Upon running the project, users can:

- Navigate: Move around the terrain using navigation controls.
- Modify Clouds: Use interactive sliders or controls to adjust cloud parameters such as opacity, density, amplitude, and movement speed.
- Control Lighting: Experiment with different lighting scenarios enabled by a ray tracing algorithm.
- Activate Cinematic Views: Trigger cinematic sequences that provide different viewpoints of the scene.
